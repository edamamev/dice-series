# Dice Series
A script [edamamev](https://github.com/edamamev) wrote up to list every dice combination.

A dice combination is called a 'Roll'

The list includes what dice are included in the roll, the expected value, and the range (+/-) from the expected value that the roll can reach.

Just a simple python script.
